  `Let's imagine a museum and write some prompts to generate paintings for it. Choose a theme, an artist, and a twist.\nExample themes: portrait of a cat, skyline of an alien city, scene of a piano player inside a speakeasy\nExample artists: Pablo Picasso, Zdzislaw Beksinski, M.C. Escher\nExample twists: in a vividly colorful style, in the year 3900, in a dark living forest\nHere's an example prompt: impressionistic close-up portrait of an otter, colorful geometric background, painting by jim woodring. Please return ${nPrompts} such prompts that are variations on a single theme. Be sure to return exactly ${nPrompts}, no more or less.\nChoose a color palette for a museum. Use hex strings like \"#000000\". Return three colors: one lighter, one medium, and one darker. These are for the walls, floor, and ceiling, and should be colored to fit the theme but not overly saturated.\nCall the generateMuseum function to generate the contents of our museum.\n`;
